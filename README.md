# Neural-Network-Visualizer-Web-App
Neural Network Visualizer Web App with Python

In this project, we will use a simple neural network with two hidden layers and one output layer. We will visualized the output values of only nodes of all these layers. Through this project, we will learn how to create a simple server, that flask to serve our neural network model for inference, a simple web application with streamlit.

### Below are the key objectives of this project:
1.	Create a model server with Flask and Keras
2.	Create a web application with Streamlit
3.	Utilize Keras' functional API

### Below is the summary of the tasks performed in this project:
- __Task 1:__ Load Libraries and Data
- __Task 2:__ Data Normalization
- __Task 3:__ Create and Train a Neural Network Model
- __Task 4:__ Create a Model Server with Flask
- __Task 5:__ Create a Streamlit Web Application
